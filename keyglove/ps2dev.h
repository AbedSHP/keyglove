/*
 * ps2.h - a library to interface with ps2 hosts.
 * Written by Chris J. Kiick, January 2008.
 * modified by Gene E. Scogin, August 2008.
 * Release into public domain.
 *
 * limitations:
 *      we do not handle parity errors.
 *      The timing constants are hard coded from the spec. Data rate is
 *      not impressive. Probably lots of room for optimization.
